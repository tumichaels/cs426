I spent a lot of reading the code, like a lot more time than I really feel was necessary, but ultimately I think I got a better understanding of the process by which the code works. Specifically, how we can interact with protobuf by compiling protobuf to golang. I thought that was a really interesting process. Another thing that was helpful was learning the patterns of how to write concurrent applications like this. I think the biggest issue was finding the correct level of abstraction. Initially i wanted to pull some of the error handling into separate functions, but in the end it seemed easiest to just handle everything in the main code, which lead to a lot of repeated code, which might have been unnecessary
