I spent a loong time on the tour of go, which was ultimately only kind of helpful. I think the go language was pretty easy to pick up, but it wasn't really motivated, if that makes sense. I also wrestled a bit with the best way of implementing the semaphore. I was pretty against using a channel or some kind of spinlock with select, but it ended up being the only option which seemed viable. I really wanted to do something with a condition variable, because that's how I learned it, but I ultimately didn't have one available.
